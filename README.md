# Dynamic Web Server (NodeJS)

Completed during the 2015-2016 Autumn Semester at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Based off the following project spec:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cb-JknmnwxKItTl8B9JYyYKkUXwdnBnBJSfsSyGhFtw/edit?usp=sharing

Essentially it's an implementation of certain parts of [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/).

Example usage can be found within partialTesters.js

Smashed together in 2-3 days of coffee-fueled sleeplessness, but it's functional and fairly efficient.
Will provide full instructions on usage eventually; it could probably be extended to handle some cooler stuff, but express have pretty much done that already, so not much point.
