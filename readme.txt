What was hard in this

- Getting rid of all the little mistakes that were causing the tests to fail.
- Time management.
- Making good design decisions.
-Usually,understanding what needed to be done was harder than actually implementing the functionality.

Note:

Static ex2 resources accessed by a use case similar to:

server.use("/static", server.static("www"));

and accessing a url such as : "http://localhost:8888/static/IT_Ex2/climbing.jpg"
(obviously change the port number according to what you've set it as.)


Passes all tests except the body-parser middleware which isn't required according to the forums.
